Really. This is the most fun I've actually had in a very long time. Believe me when I say I enjoy programming. Even if it means I'll be unemployed forever.

I've been trying to figure github out, and I think I've finally got it.

I've made many projects, but they either aren't public, or are still linked to college. So the public ones aren't that interesting, I know.

## What do I do?
Interesting stuff, I'd like to think. Mostly mess with whatever seems interesting that day.
I have a few websites.
A good way of getting a feeling of what I like to do, is probably through [my website](JustACat.me) (not the [femboy](Realfemboy.Tech) one)

:zap: Languages I know :zap:
